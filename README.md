# eaa_crc_classifier

This repo contains R script and data file used for the analyses presented in Frontiers in Genetics paper.

In particular, the parts of the code are dedicated to the epigenetic age acceleration calculation and training a classifier of the CRC status for the pathologically normal colon.

The data file contains calculated epigenetic age and clinical information obtained from the open access repositories (NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress).

The folder association_analyses_plots contains R scripts to calculate EAAs for association analyses using the methods described in the manuscript, and to produce the plots for the associations between EA/EAA and CRC status together with corresponding data files in .RData format.
